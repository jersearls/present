Hi <%= @user.name.split(" ").first %>,

It's been <%= AccidentalPairing.days_since_last_pairing_for(@user) %> days since you last logged a non-routine pair-programming session in Present.

(You've asked to be reminded every <%= @user.days_between_pair_reminders %> days.)

Hopefully, you find an opportunity to break with your routine soon and pair on something out of the ordinary!

You can log your next pairing session here:

<%= accidental_pairings_url %>

Thanks,

Doubot
