Hi Admins!

We tried to send a timesheet reminder to <%= @user.name %> for this week, but
they didn't have an e-mail address in the system. (This happens when they don't
publicize their email in their Github profile.)

To add one, set it in production with Rails console:

$ heroku run rails c
> User.find(<%= @user.id %>).github_account.update!(:email => "THEIR EMAIL")

In the meantime, you should manually let them know their timesheet needs to
be marked ready for invoice.
