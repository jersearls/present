Hey <%= @user.name.split(" ").first %>,

It's an invoicing week! That means Present needs your billable activities logged
for this week and last week. Could you hop on, verify your time, and mark that
you're ready for your time to be invoiced to your clients?

<%= Rails.application.config.present.url + current_week_path %>

Thanks!
